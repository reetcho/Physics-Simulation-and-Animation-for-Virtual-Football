# Controllable Ball Physics Simulation
This repository contains the project for my Master’s Thesis in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at Technical University of Denmark (DTU).
It is a real-time, controllable simulation of a spinning football built in Unity/C#.

The simulation models all major physical forces on the ball—aerodynamic forces, bounces, and ground friction—to reproduce a realistic behaviour.
Multiple numerical integration methods are implemented and compared for accuracy and performance, including Explicit Euler, Semi-Implicit Euler and Runge–Kutta.

The project also includes shot-prediction systems that compute the initial values needed for the ball to reach a specified target.

A playable build of the project is available on [itch.io](https://reetcho.itch.io).
