# Controllable Ball Physics Simulation
This repository contains a real-time simulation of a spinning football developed in Unity for my Master’s Thesis in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

The simulation models aerodynamic force, bounces, and ground friction.
It includes multiple numerical integration methods—such as Semi-Implicit Euler, Explicit Euler, and Runge–Kutta—implemented and compared to evaluate accuracy and real-time performance.

Full technical details are available in the Master’s Thesis PDF included in this repository.

A playable build of the project is available on [itch.io](https://reetcho.itch.io).
